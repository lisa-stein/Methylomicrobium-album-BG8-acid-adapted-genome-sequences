The files contain the PacBio sequencing data for genomes of Methylomicrobium album BG8 that were adapted to growth at low pH. One set of files is for adaptation using methane as a carbon source (bc1100) and the other is for methanol as a carbon source (bc1109). These genomes support the publication, "Prolific shedding of S-layer by the methanotrophic bacterium Methylomicrobium album BG8" by Hermary et al. 2025
